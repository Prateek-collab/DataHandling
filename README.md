# DataHandling
Working with Databases.
This is a step towards handling databases and GUI simultaneously.
The GUI here is designed to add, show, update or delete a record as per the user's choice.
Each of which perfoems a specific function as directed in the function.
Thus using simple python GUI i tried to design a data entry record book.
1st commit- Mydb.py is the basic gui file that holds the basic model with the add and show record functionality.
2nd commit- Mydbv2.py adds update and delete record functionality to the existing model.
